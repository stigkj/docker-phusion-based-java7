# Docker image with Oracle Java 7

This image is based on [phusion's baseimage](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker), which is a modified Ubuntu
with a lot of problems related to running as a Docker image fixed. It also adds a very nice init and service management
system that works properly in a Docker image.

Oracle's JDK version 7 is installed on top of this image.
